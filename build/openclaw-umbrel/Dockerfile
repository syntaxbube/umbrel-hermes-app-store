# Shim systemctl for Docker — there's no systemd in the container, but OpenClaw's
# agent calls `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway` to restart the gateway.
# This script skips flags like --user to find the subcommand. Restart kills the
# gateway by its process title ("openclaw-gateway"), while start/stop acknowledge
# that lifecycle is container-owned. The wrapper observes restart and relaunches
# the Gateway with bounded backoff.
# `|| true` prevents pkill's non-zero exit code from making the restart look like
# a failure to the agent. Anchor the pkill match so it only catches the gateway
# process, not this shim's own argv (`systemctl ... openclaw-gateway.service`).
